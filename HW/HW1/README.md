# Gold Price Trend Prediction Project
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Investment firms and individual investors are facing uncertainty about gold as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. With recent rapid price increases, the key question is: "Will gold's price continue to rise rapidly in the following year?" This matters because gold represents a significant portfolio allocation for many investors, and timing decisions around gold exposure can impact returns by 10-30% annually. Poor timing on gold investments can lead to substantial opportunity costs, especially when alternative assets like stocks or bonds might offer better risk-adjusted returns.

## Stakeholder & User
**Decision Maker:** Portfolio managers and investment advisors who determine asset allocation strategies for client portfolios. **Tool User:** Investment research analysts who will incorporate the forecast into their daily market analysis and client presentations. The output needs to be ready for portfolio review meetings and updated frequently for ongoing monitoring.

## Useful Answer & Decision
**Type:** Predictive analysis (forecasting future price movements). **Metric:** 12-month gold price forecast with confidence intervals, probability of >10% price increase, and downside risk assessment. **Artifact:** Monthly dashboard showing current forecast vs. actual performance, risk-adjusted return comparison vs. alternative assets, and clear buy/hold/sell recommendations with supporting rationale.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical price data availability going back 10+ years for robust modeling
- Monthly model updates
- Focus on USD-denominated gold prices

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Unprecedented monetary policy impacts on traditional gold-inflation relationships
- Geopolitical events (wars, trade disputes) causing unpredictable price spikes
- Central bank gold purchasing policies and cryptocurrency adoption effects
- Model performance degradation during market regime changes
- **Monitoring Plan:** Monthly model performance review, quarterly assumption validation, real-time tracking of prediction intervals vs. actual prices
