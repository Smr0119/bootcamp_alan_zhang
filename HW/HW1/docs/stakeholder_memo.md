# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Portfolio Management Team  
**FROM:** Investment Research Analytics  
**DATE:** August 2025
**RE:** Gold Price Trend Analysis Project - Phase 1 Scoping

## Executive Summary

We are initiating a predictive analytics project to address the critical question: **"Will gold's price continue to rise rapidly in the following year?"** This analysis will directly support your portfolio allocation decisions and provide ongoing market information for market consulting, etc.

## Business Context & Urgency

Gold currently represents a significant portion of many client portfolios as an inflation hedge and volatility dampener. With gold prices experiencing significant volatility and recent rapid increases, timing decisions around gold exposure have become increasingly critical to portfolio performance.

## What You'll Receive

**Primary Deliverable:** Monthly dashboard providing:
- 12-month gold price forecast with statistical confidence bands
- Probability assessment of >10% price appreciation
- Downside risk quantification 
- Performance comparison vs. alternative assets (bonds, equities, REITs)
- Clear actionable recommendations: BUY / HOLD / REDUCE exposure

## Key Assumptions & Limitations

**Data Foundation:**
- 10+ years of historical gold price data
- Integration with publicly available economic indicators

**Model Constraints:**
- Focused on 12-month forward-looking predictions
- Excludes proprietary economic data due to compliance requirements
- Interpretable model architecture required for client explanation and regulatory review

## Risk Factors We're Monitoring

1. **Unprecedented Monetary Policy:** Central bank digital currencies and extended zero-interest rate policies may alter traditional gold-inflation relationships
2. **Geopolitical Volatility:** Ongoing conflicts and trade tensions create unpredictable price shock potential
3. **Cryptocurrency Competition:** Digital assets may be substituting for gold as alternative stores of value
4. **Central Bank Activity:** Sovereign gold purchasing patterns increasingly impact supply-demand dynamics

## Success Metrics

**Model Performance:** Forecast accuracy within Â±15% of actual prices for 12-month predictions  
**Business Impact:** Improved risk-adjusted returns on gold allocation decisions, measured quarterly  
**Client Value:** Enhanced confidence in advisory recommendations, measured through client satisfaction scores

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1-2:** Data acquisition and historical validation
2. **Week 3-4:** Model development and backtesting  
3. **Week 5:** Stakeholder review and dashboard prototype
4. **Week 6:** Production deployment and first forecast delivery

## Questions for Leadership Review

1. **Risk Tolerance:** What confidence level threshold should trigger allocation recommendation changes?
2. **Client Communication:** How detailed should model explanations be in client-facing materials?
3. **Integration:** Should this system interface with existing portfolio management software?
