# Gold Price Prediction Project - Tooling Setup

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict gold price trends over the next 12 months. The goal is to provide portfolio managers and investment advisors with data-driven insights for making informed gold allocation decisions. Using historical price data and economic indicators, we'll build predictive models that output actionable buy/hold/sell recommendations with confidence intervals and risk assessments.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Raw and processed gold price data, economic indicators
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and prototyping
- `src/` - Python modules for data processing, modeling, and configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables and API keys (not committed to version control)
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a Python environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
4. Run `notebooks/00_project_setup.ipynb`
